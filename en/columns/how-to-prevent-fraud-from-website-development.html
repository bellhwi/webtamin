                First, how to prevent ‘Eat-and-run’ fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/fraud image-1.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              ‘Eat-and-run’ is a type of fraud in which you
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >invest a small amount of money to set up a company and then
                take the customer's advance money and disappear</strong
              >. The easiest way to determine the reliability of your business
              is to do so. If you have a web development business in mind, try
              the following.
            </div>
            <div>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
                <li>Access the website.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to the bottom of the website.</li>
                <li>
                  Check whether there is any identification information such as
                  the employee identification number(EIN) given by the
                  government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If not, check other relevant pages, such as contacting,
                  introducing, and so on.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              Did you find it? Congratulations. The probability that the company
              is a ‘Eat-and-run’ type has decreased significantly.
            </div>
            <div>
              But this alone is not conclusive. If you're a clever conman, you
              can even manipulate this. We need to look closely at other aspects
              as well.
            </div>
            <div>
              The next step is to contact your old customer. Most web
              development websites have testimonials or reviews from previous
              customers. Select one of the cases and enter the website.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Find the contact information and send them an inquiry </strong
              >about the service of the company you are investigating. The
              inquiry may consist of a short survey about the name of the
              company and satisfaction level that you received. If you get a
              positive response, the reliability of the company will increase
              significantly.

                Second, how to prevent ‘He cries wine and sells vinegar’ fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/fraud image-2.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              The ‘He cries wine and sells vinegar’ is a type in which
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >an incompetent individual steals other people's work and
                deceives customers as if they were experts</strong
              >. How can you tell the authenticity of a portfolio in a web
              development company?
            </div>
            <div>
              As mentioned earlier, you can contact your old customer directly.
              But there's no guarantee of a reply. Even if they do, you don't
              know how long it will take.
            </div>
            <div>
              There is a more direct way to verify. It requires

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >the web development company to prove the previous work</strong
              >.
            </div>
            <div>
              Typically, web development businesses keep previous work files of
              customers. Because it is necessary for post-maintenance. These
              files consist primarily of source code.
            </div>
            <div>
              Source code is simply a file that creates the internal structure
              of a website. This allows you to load the same website that you
              asked for on your personal computer. And you can easily change
              what you see, such as the title, the body, and the color of the
              text.
            </div>
            <div>
              Even if you don't understand this part well, there's no problem at
              all. It's enough to know that there's something like this. You can
              request the following from the company.
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="italic">
                "We would like to inquire about the authenticity of your
                portfolio. Could you please record a short video of some source
                code modifications reflecting the changes on the website? I'd
                appreciate it if you could share it using the Google Drive
                link."
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              If there is no reply or if they refuse the request for an
              unconvincing reason, it is a red light.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">

                Third, the prevention of rip-off fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/fraud image-3.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              Rip-off is a type that

              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >charges excessively for basic services or requires unreasonable
                additional costs</strong
              >.
            </div>
            <div>
              The first thing to do as a precaution is to do some legworks. We
              recommend that you
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >request a quote from at least three companies</strong
              >. If you ask about 5 companies, you can know the average market
              price to some extent.
            </div>
            <div>
              Quotations typically come with the proposals. It consists
              primarily of an overview of the service. Some places offer
              contracts more formally. It must contain a detailed description of
              the service in any format.
            </div>
            <div>
              Is there a place that induces payment without a word of details?
              If so, quit that website without hesitation for a second.
            </div>
            <div>
              Check whether there is a proposal or contract. What's important
              here is that you really have to 'check'. Don't skim through as if
              it's like the terms and conditions of membership or something on
              any website.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >You should carefully read the project description, development
                period, development cost, refund conditions, maintenance,
                etc.</strong
              >
              You have to take your time to examine whether all the provisions
              are reasonable, whether there are any ambiguities, and whether
              there are any questions. Make sure there are additional costs for
              design, functionality, page count, hosting costs, etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              If there are any expenses that you don't understand, you should
              ask. If any sentence in the contract feels clueless, you must ask
              for a clear explanation. If there is something you are not sure
              about, even if it's trivial, you should ask.
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >If you find it annoying to go over the contract, it can cause a
                worse annoying situation in the future.</strong

              So far, we've looked at three typical scams in the web development
              industry. Let me sum up. In order to prevent fraud by requesting
              website development, please do the following.
            </div>
            <ul class="list-disc font-bold ml-8">
              <li>Confirming Business Registration</li>
              <li>Contact your old customer</li>
              <li>Ask businesses to authenticate their portfolios</li>
              <li>Find out at least 3 different companies' estimates</li>
              <li>Review proposals and contracts</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              Don't just easily believe everything you see. Make sure to examine
              the credibility of the information provided by the business.
