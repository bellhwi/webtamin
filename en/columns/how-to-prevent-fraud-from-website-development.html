              creating websites.

                First, how to prevent ‘Eat-and-run’ fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/running-man.webp"
              alt="running man in the city"
            />
            <div>
              ‘Eat-and-run’ is a type of fraud in which you
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >invest a small amount of money to set up a company and then
                take the customer's advance money and disappear</strong
              >. The easiest way to determine the reliability of your business
              is to do so. If you have a web development business in mind, try
              the following.
            </div>
            <div>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
                <li>Access the website.</li>
                <li>Check the company's address.</li>
                <li>
                  Look up for the business name search service on the homepage
                  of the county where the address belongs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check the business name (ex.FBN, DBA, etc.) to see if it is
                  registered correctly.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              Did you find it? Congratulations. The probability that the company
              is a ‘Eat-and-run’ type has decreased significantly. But this
              alone is not conclusive. If you're a clever conman, you can even
              manipulate this. We need to look closely at other aspects as well.
            </div>
            <div>
              The next step is to contact your old customer. Most web
              development websites have testimonials or reviews from previous
              customers. Select one of the cases and enter the website.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Find the contact information and send them an inquiry </strong
              >about the service of the company you are investigating. The
              inquiry may consist of a short survey about the name of the
              company and satisfaction level that you received. If you get a
              positive response, the reliability of the company will increase
              significantly.

                Second, how to prevent ‘He cries wine and sells vinegar’ fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/mask-man.webp"
              alt="person with mask"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              The ‘He cries wine and sells vinegar’ is a type in which
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >an incompetent individual steals other people's work and
                deceives customers as if they were experts</strong
              >. How can you tell the authenticity of a portfolio in a web
              development company?
            </div>
            <div>
              As mentioned earlier, you can contact your old customer directly.
              But there's no guarantee of a reply. Even if they do, you don't
              know how long it will take.
            </div>
            <div>
              There is a more direct way to verify. It requires

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >the web development company to prove the previous work</strong
              >.
            </div>
            <div>
              Typically, web development businesses keep previous work files of
              customers. Because it is necessary for post-maintenance. These
              files consist primarily of source code.
            </div>
            <div>
              Source code is simply a file that creates the internal structure
              of a website. This allows you to load the same website that you
              asked for on your personal computer. And you can easily change
              what you see, such as the title, the body, and the color of the
              text.
            </div>
            <div>
              Even if you don't understand this part well, there's no problem at
              all. It's enough to know that there's something like this. You can
              request the following from the company.
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="italic">
                "We would like to inquire about the authenticity of your
                portfolio. Could you please record a short video of some source
                code modifications reflecting the changes on the website? I'd
                appreciate it if you could share it using the Google Drive
                link."
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              You might wonder what this is all about. So I've prepared the
              example below.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/portfolio.webp"

            />
            <div>
              The right side of the image above is the portfolio website of
              Webtamin's customer. The dark notepad-like area on the left is
              part of the source code. If you look at the image, you can see the
              code is being changed to revise an existing bright wallpaper to
              black.

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >This can prove that the company actually developed the
                website.</strong

            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">

                Third, the prevention of rip-off fraud.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/dollars.webp"
              alt="100 dollar bills"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              Rip-off is a type that

              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >charges excessively for basic services or requires unreasonable
                additional costs</strong
              >.
            </div>
            <div>
              The first thing to do as a precaution is to do some legworks. We
              recommend that you
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >request a quote from at least three companies</strong
              >. If you ask about 5 companies, you can know the average market
              price to some extent. Quotations typically come with the
              proposals. It consists primarily of an overview of the service.
              Some places offer contracts more formally. It must contain a
              detailed description of the service in any format.
            </div>
            <div>
              Is there a place that induces payment without a word of details?
              If so, quit that website without hesitation for a second.
            </div>
            <div>
              Next, check whether there is a proposal or contract. What's
              important here is that you really have to 'check'. Don't skim
              through as if it's like the terms and conditions of membership or
              something on any website.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >You should carefully read the project description, development
                period, development cost, refund conditions, maintenance,
                etc.</strong
              >
              You have to take your time to examine whether all the provisions
              are reasonable, whether there are any ambiguities, and whether
              there are any questions. Make sure there are additional costs for
              design, functionality, page count, hosting costs, etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              If there are any expenses that you don't understand, you should
              ask. If any sentence in the contract feels clueless, you must ask
              for a clear explanation. If there is something you are not sure
              about, even if it's trivial, you should ask.
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >If you find it annoying to go over the contract, it can cause a
                worse annoying situation in the future.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <img

              The screenshot above is part of Webtamin's actual customer
              contract. To protect the personal information, the customer's name
              is covered. Webtamin writes contracts for the creation of all
              websites. After that,
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >the project will be carried out after mutual signatures between

              So far, we've looked at three typical scams in the web development
              industry. Let me sum up. In order to prevent fraud by requesting
              website development, please do the following.
            </div>
            <ul class="list-disc font-bold ml-8">
              <li>Confirming Business Registration</li>
              <li>Contact your old customer</li>
              <li>Ask businesses to authenticate their portfolios</li>
              <li>Find out at least 3 different companies' estimates</li>
              <li>Review proposals and contracts</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              Don't just easily believe everything you see. Make sure to examine
              the credibility of the information provided by the business.
