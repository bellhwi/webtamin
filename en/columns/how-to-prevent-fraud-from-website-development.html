              This column is a follow-up to the previous column, '3 Reasons why
              there are scammers in website development'. Please refer to this

                1. Eat-and-run
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/running-man.webp"
              alt="running man in the city"
            />
            <div>
              'Eat-and-run' is a type of fraud in which you
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >invest a small amount of money to set up a company and then
                take the customer's advance money and disappear.</strong
              >
              The easiest way to determine the reliability of your business is
              to do so. If you have a web development business in mind, try the
              following.
            </div>
            <div>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
                <li>Access the website.</li>
                <li>Check the company's address.</li>
                <li>
                  Look up the business name search service on the county's
                  homepage where the address belongs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check the business name (ex.FBN, DBA, etc.) to see if it is
                  registered correctly.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
              Did you find it? Congratulations. The company's probability of
              being an 'Eat-and-run' type has decreased significantly. But this
              alone is not conclusive. If you're a clever conman, you can even
              manipulate this. We need to look closely at other aspects as well.
            </div>
            <div>
              The next step is to contact your old customer. Most web
              development websites have testimonials or reviews from previous
              customers. Select one of the cases and enter the website.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Find the contact information and send them an inquiry</strong
              >
              about the service of the company you are investigating. The
              inquiry may consist of a short survey about the name of the
              company and the satisfaction level you received. The company's
              reliability will increase if you get a positive response.
            </div>
            <img

              The image above shows the business name search results in
              Sacramento County. You can see that the name of Webtamin is
              registered correctly.

                2. 'He cries wine and sells vinegar'
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img

            />
            <div>
              The 'He cries wine and sells vinegar' is when
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >an incompetent individual steals other people's work</strong
              >
              and deceives customers as if they were experts. How can you tell
              the authenticity of a portfolio in a web development company?
            </div>
            <div>
              As mentioned earlier, you can contact your old customer directly.
              But there's no guarantee of a reply. Even if they do, you don't
              know how long it will take.
            </div>
            <div>
              There is a more direct way to verify. It requires
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >the web development company to prove the previous work.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              Typically, web development businesses keep customers' previous
              work files. Because it is necessary for post-maintenance, these
              files consist primarily of source code.
            </div>
            <div>
              Source code is simply a file that creates a website's internal
              structure. This allows you to load the website you requested on
              your personal computer. You can easily change what you see, such
              as the title, the body, and the color of the text.
            </div>
            <div>
              Even if you don't understand this part well, there's no problem.
              It's enough to know that there's something like this. You can
              request the following from the company.
            </div>
            <div class="italic">
              "We would like to inquire about the authenticity of your
              portfolio. Please record a short video of some source code
              modifications reflecting the changes on the website. I'd
              appreciate your sharing it using the Google Drive link."
            </div>
            <div>
              You might wonder what this is all about. So, I've prepared the
              example below.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/portfolio.webp"
              alt="editing website portfolio"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              The right side of the image above is the portfolio website of
              Webtamin's customers. The dark notepad-like area on the left is
              part of the source code. If you look at the image, you can see the
              code is being changed to revise an existing bright wallpaper to
              black.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >This can prove that the company developed the website.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">3. Rip-off</h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/dollars.webp"
              alt="100 dollar bills"
              class="my-8"
            />
            <div>
              The rip-off is a type that
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >charges excessively for essential services or requires
                unreasonable additional costs.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              The first thing to do as a precaution is to do some legwork. We
              recommend that you
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >request a quote from at least three companies.</strong
              >
              You can know the average market price if you ask about five
              companies. Quotations typically come with the proposals. It
              consists primarily of an overview of the service. Some places
              offer contracts more formally. It must contain a detailed
              description of the service in any format.
            </div>
            <div>
              Is there a place that induces payment without a word of details?
              If so, quit that website without hesitation for a second.
            </div>
            <div>
              Next, check whether there is a proposal or contract. What's
              important here is that you have to 'check.' Don't skim through as
              if it's like the terms and conditions of membership or something
              on any website.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >You should carefully read the project description, development
                period, cost, refund conditions, maintenance, etc.</strong
              >
              You have to take your time to examine whether all the provisions
              are reasonable, whether there are any ambiguities, and whether
              there are any questions. Ensure there are additional costs for
              design, functionality, page count, hosting, etc.
            </div>
            <div>
              You should ask if there are any expenses you don't understand. If
              any sentence in the contract feels clueless, you must ask for a
              clear explanation. You should ask if there is something you are
              unsure about, even if it's trivial.
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >If you find it annoying to go over the contract, it can cause a
                worse annoying situation in the future.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/how-to-prevent-fraud-from-website-development/contract_eng.webp"
              alt="webtamin contract form"

              The screenshot above is part of Webtamin's actual customer
              contract. The customer's name is covered to protect the privacy.
              Webtamin writes contracts for the creation of all websites. After
              that,
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >the project will be carried out after mutual signatures are
                obtained from the company and the client.</strong

              So far, we've looked at three typical scams in the web development
              industry. Let me sum up. To prevent fraud by requesting website
              development, please do the following.
            </div>
            <ul class="list-disc font-bold ml-8">
              <li>Confirming Business Registration</li>

              <li>Find out at least 3 different companies' estimates</li>
              <li>Review proposals and contracts</li>
            </ul>
