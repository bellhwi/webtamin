            There are two main ways to create a website. The first method is to
            create a template based on a pre-made function and design framework.
            The second is to develop everything from scratch without templates.
            In this column, we will cover the

            <strong class="bg-yellow-200">benefits of custom websites</strong>
            and downsides of template based websites.

              >
              You'll see how custom websites can go beyond these limits. Let's
              take a look at three reasons why you want to have a custom
              website.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">

              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                First, unique branding.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/branding.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              Brand means a unique impression of a company's products and
              services. Branding refers to the overall process of creating a
              brand. The goal of branding is to give consumers a unique
              perception of the company.
            </div>
            <div>
              The main purpose of the website is to maximize branding. All
              elements of the website, including layout, logo, color,
              typography, and images, should represent the unique brand of the
              company.
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >The template comes in a pre-made form of these design
                parts.</strong
              >
              Depending on the template, the range of adjustable elements may
              vary, but most of them are constrained. This makes it difficult to
              implement a design that fits your company's brand.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites have 100% control over their
              design. All visual elements of the website can be adjusted freely
              as desired. Design can express the uniqueness of the brand.
              Therefore, it is much more advantageous to

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >imprint the brand on visitors</strong
              >
              than on a uniform template website.
            </div>
            <div>
              Different branding is required to represent the unique value
              contained in a brand's products and services. Websites with
              impressions like you've seen before have limitations in revealing
              the brand's unique identity.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                Second, no restrictions on functional implementation.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/coding.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              The template website is subject to functional restrictions.
              Websites can only be
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >built within the scope of pre-made features.</strong
              >
              There are often restrictions on integrating payment systems,
              linking external business tools, search and filter capabilities,
              and the ability to provide customized content to users.
            </div>
            <div>
              Here's a website of a law firm built from a template. There is a
              blog inside the website and there are 100 articles in various
              categories such as inheritance law, immigration law, and divorce
              law. Visitor Paul is curious about the U.S. immigration law. He'd
              like to read only posts related to immigration laws out of 100
              articles. However, the blog page does not show anything to filter.
              The only way to navigate the page is to manually scroll it. He
              feels uncomfortable, so he wants to look around other law firms'
              websites.
            </div>
            <div>
              Later, he found a custom-made law firm website. This website also
              has a professional blog inside. On the page, the inheritance law,
              immigration law, and divorce law are separated by tabs. The
              sorting function exists, allowing you to view posts in order of
              latest and popularity. Search is also possible, allowing you to
              look up posts around specific keywords. He is satisfied with the
              more convenient user experience compared to the previous website.
            </div>
            <div>
              In this example, you can see how custom websites can implement
              features

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >aimed at the needs of visitors.</strong
              >
              Because there are no technical limitations to developing the
              function. Websites that meet the needs of visitors will have a
              positive impact on the brand's impression. Good awareness of the
              brand is the starting point for creating demand for the products
              and services.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                Third, faster loading time.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/loading.jpg"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              When you visit the website, you may have clicked go back or closed
              the window because of the long loading time. After three seconds
              of loading, most visitors leave the site. The latency that occurs
              when using a website has a significant impact on user
              satisfaction. Therefore, the difference between 1 and 2 seconds of
              loading time is very important when creating a website.
            </div>
            <div>
              Template websites typically have slower loading times. To be
              precise,

              <strong class="text-red-500">
                there are factors that can slow down loading speed, and it is
                almost impossible to control them.</strong
              >
              These includes;
            </div>
            <div>
              First, an oversized image file. You need a blog thumbnail image of
              400 x 300 pixels here. However, the original image you want to use
              is 4000 x 3000 pixels in size. In this case, you should reduce the
              loading speed by reducing the image to match the thumbnail size.
              This is called image optimization, and sometimes the template
              website does not support it. This causes loading unnecessarily
              large size image files which takes more time.
            </div>
            <div>
              Next is JavaScript and CSS files. Don't be flustered by unfamiliar
              terms. Think of it simply as a file related to the appearance and
              behavior of the website. Templates often load these files even
              from unnecessary pages.
            </div>
            <div>
              In addition, template websites are relatively slow to load due to
              inefficient code, unoptimized third-party plug-ins, and excessive
              external script file calls.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites can optimize image files to the
              right size. You can design related files to load only where they
              are needed. You can reduce loading time by creating efficient
              code. You can have

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >most control over all the technical aspects related to loading
                speed.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              The loading speed is a factor that is directly related to the
              user's satisfaction. A website that loads fast will increase
              visitor satisfaction. High-satisfaction users have no choice but
              to have a good impression on the brand.
            </div>

            <div class="py-8"><hr class="w-1/2" /></div>
            <div>
              So far, we've covered three reasons why you want to have custom
              websites. The reasons are as follows.
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Unique branding</li>
              <li>No restrictions on functional implementation</li>
              <li>Faster loading speed</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              On the vast land of online, there are countless stores called
              websites. A store with a unique exterior can catch the eye of
              customers. A store that provides customers' needs and facilitates
              their convenience makes visitors happy. They want to visit the
              store again, where the road to visit is open without being
              blocked.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Creating websites that satisfy users is the starting point for
                online branding.</strong
              >
              The template website has the advantage of being relatively easy to
              create, low price and short production period. However, due to the
              inherent limitations of the template, there are restrictions on
              creating websites that fit the brand perfectly.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites are customized for everything
              in design, function, and performance. It's relatively expensive
              and takes a long time to build, but it's optimized for
              representing the unique identity of the brand.
            </div>
            <div>
              You can make a wise decision by knowing the difference between
              template based websites and custom websites.
