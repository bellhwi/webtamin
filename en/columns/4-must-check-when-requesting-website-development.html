              Are you considering requesting a website? If so, you may be
              looking everywhere for an agency. In this column, we've covered
              things you must check when selecting an agency. We've chosen the
              four most important things
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >based on the development platforms and customer
                reviews.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              It's not complicated. Just look to see if they meet these 4
              requirements. There will be a lot less headache after the
              development request.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                1. Smooth communication
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/4-must-check-when-requesting-website-development/conversation.webp"
              alt="women's conversation"
              width="640"
              height="427"
            />
            <div>
              Communication is the most critical thing in the process of
              creating a website. For clients, there is
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >nothing more disappointing than unreachable agencies.</strong
              >
              Unanswered emails, unresponsive calls, and late replies are
              unacceptable.
            </div>
            <div>
              There are many cases where a project is in progress without any
              problems, but it happens after finishing the development. The
              client will not be able to get any of the help they need, like a
              child who has lost their parents. Maintenance work, such as
              website content updates and design revisions, will be impossible.
              When contacting the development company,
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200">check the response time.</strong>
              You may experience problems with communication afterward with the
              development company that is slow to respond.
            </div>
            <div>
              Webtamin is responsive to clients' calls quickly throughout all
              stages of development. Depending on the client's preference, they
              can reach us via email, text, or phone. Clients can communicate
              directly with a representative without complicated department
              transfers.
            </div>

            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                2. Transparent fee
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/4-must-check-when-requesting-website-development/card-payment.webp"
              alt="payment with a credit card"
              width="640"
              height="427"
            />
            <div>
              Some companies charge unexpected additional costs. There is no
              mention of any additional costs during the project. When it comes
              time to pay for the service,
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >they charge you unexplained costs.</strong
              >
              The contents include design revisions, function updates, content
              changes, etc., that you haven't heard beforehand.
            </div>
            <div>
              The client can't help but think that the agency didn't notify them
              in advance, which is unreasonable. They can't erase the feeling of
              being scammed. Conflicts with the development company are
              inevitable unless you pay the cost.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Ensure the price is specified in the proposal or
                contract</strong
              >
              provided by the development company. Please be suspicious of
              agencies where information about development costs is vague.
            </div>
            <div>
              Webtamin transparently presents all costs of development. It will
              inform you in advance of the contract what services the client
              receives and how much it costs.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Accurate delivery
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/4-must-check-when-requesting-website-development/calendar.webp"
              alt="calendar with a clock"
              width="640"
              height="427"
            />
            <div>
              Another of the main factors that cause clients to complain is the
              delay in the development period. The client receives the results
              after the development completion date they initially heard about.
              There is no reason to be convinced that the delivery date has been
              delayed. Eventually, the client's business schedule will be
              disrupted by the late website.
            </div>
            <div>
              If the
              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >delivery date is dramatically shorter</strong
              >
              than other companies, look carefully. At least it should explain
              why delivering results quickly. Webtamin is based on the principle
              of delivering the results on time. We provide the timeframe
              required for each schedule throughout the development process.

                4. High usability
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/4-must-check-when-requesting-website-development/website-planning.webp"
              alt="website planning"
              width="640"
              height="427"
            />
            <div>
              Usability is the level of satisfaction a visitor feels when using
              a website. A combination of fast loading speed, convenient page
              movement, and intuitive site structure creates good usability.
              From the user's point of view, websites that are not designed are
              bound to feel uncomfortable with each click.
            </div>
            <div>
              A client rarely has technical knowledge of the website. They often
              evaluate the website as good or bad based solely on its
              appearance. The most important thing is the usability, not the
              website's appearance. When requesting website development,
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >visit at least one of the agency's portfolio websites.</strong
              >
              Try moving several tabs and pressing the button to test it
              yourself.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/4-must-check-when-requesting-website-development/loading-speed.webp"
              alt="webtamin site speed result"
              width="640"

            <div>
              Webtamin is designing a website considering the user's experience
              from the beginning of the development stage. We are creating a
              website that maintains top-notch speed and provides a convenient
              user experience.

            <div>
              So far, we've learned four essential things to check when you're
              requesting a website.
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Smooth communication</li>
              <li>Transparent fee</li>
              <li>Accurate delivery</li>
              <li>High usability</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              Please review these things carefully when researching website
              agencies. Don't hesitate to contact us with questions or requests
              about the website design.
