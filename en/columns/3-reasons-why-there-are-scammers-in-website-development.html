              Are you confident that you won't be scammed by requesting the
              website development? Then you may exit this page. However, If not,
              please take your time and read this article.
            </div>
            <div>
              There are several types of fraud in the website development
              industry. In this column, we will look at the

              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >prevailing customer deception behavior in web business.</strong
              >
              There are inherent reasons why website development is vulnerable
              to these scams. Letâ€™s break it into three reasons.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">

                First, it's a financially low barrier to business entry.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/low-financial-barrier.webp"
              alt="low financial barrier"
            />
            <div>
              Starting a website development business costs relatively little.
              Let me give you an example.
            </div>
            <div>
              How much would it cost to open a cafe? First, you have to pay a
              premium and rent for the actual use of the building. Wallpaper,
              paint, counters, tables, chairs, props, coffee machines, etc. must
              be purchased for the interior and equipment. You also need to pay
              for coffee ingredients, drinks, and dessert food. There are labor
              costs for hiring employees as well. You also have to pay utility
              bills such as electricity and water bills. A large amount of money
              is spent to start the business.
            </div>
            <div>
              What about the website development business? Let's take a look for
              the most accessible business form which is run by an individual.
              You don't need a building. You can make and operate a website at
              home. You don't need interior design. The design of the website is
              interior design. One laptop with an Internet connection is
              sufficient for equipment. No labor costs are required. You can
              start a business with

              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"> barely any expense.</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              This is where the so-called 'Eat-and-run' problem occurs. They can

              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >close the business after the customer's down payment.</strong
              >
              This amount is more than their initial expense for the business.
              This is why many ghost companies disappear only for advance
              payments. It is a problem caused by the low barriers to entering
              the business financially.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                Second, it's easy to manipulate information.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/anonymous.webp"
              alt="anonymous image"
            />
            <div>
              How do previous ghost companies open consumers' wallets? The
              Internet is basically where anonymity is guaranteed. It's hard for
              someone to identify you unless you disclose it.
            </div>
            <div>
              Bad website development businesses take advantage of this. They
              fabricate websites with

              <strong class="text-red-500"
                >fake portfolios, careers, and reviews.</strong
              >
              They pretend to be professionals. It is not easy for customers to
              determine the authenticity of this information. Eventually, they
              are deceived by manipulated information and pay for the service
              fee.
            </div>
            <div>
              The customer will then receive poor deliverables. It is an unknown
              company that has not been registered as a business even if you try
              to take legal action afterwards. The country or region in which
              the company belongs is also unknown and cannot even be identified.
              The email and phone number of the company you received are also
              unavailable for one-time contact.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Fraud companies deceive customers with their fake
                appearance.</strong
              >
              He cries wine and sells vinegar.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                Third, it requires technical knowledge of web development.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../../images/columns/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/coding.webp"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              Web development requires technical knowledge. Customers in other
              industries rarely have it. Therefore, It's hard to know the
              technical aspects of how websites are created. How do scammers
              deceive customers with this?
            </div>
            <div>
              Let's take another example of a previous cafe. Customers order
              coffee made from high-quality beans. However, the bad cafe owner
              takes advantage of the fact that customers don't know coffee well.
              And they serve coffee with low-cost beans sold at regular marts.
              The customer doesn't know, yet he's reluctant and asks to check.
              The vice owner will then mix unknown jargon and say that's the way
              it is. The customer agrees as if there is no choice.
            </div>
            <div>
              The above story can be applied directly to the web development
              business. Replace web development for the cafe. A website for
              coffee. Read the basic/premium websites by substituting them for
              low-cost/high-end.

              <strong class="text-red-500">
                Such substandard deliverables are deceiving customers as if they
                were industry standards.</strong
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, they charge excessive development costs for
              basic services. A simple code correction can cost you 30% of the
              development cost.
            </div>
            <div>
              Some businesses steal copyrighted online materials without
              permission. Customers may be caught in legal action later on for
              copyright infringement without knowing this.
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200"
                >Without basic knowledge of web development, you may be
                vulnerable to fraud.
              </strong>
            </div>
            <div class="py-8"><hr class="w-1/2" /></div>
            <div>
              So far, we've looked at three reasons why there are so many
              scammers in the web development industry. Letâ€™s sum up.
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong
                >First, the web development business has a low financial entry
                barrier. </strong
              ><br />
              Some people think they have nothing to lose and turn their backs
              on customers.
              <br />
              <strong
                >Second, web development businesses are easy to manipulate
                information. </strong
              ><br />
              It's not hard at all to open an online store with fabricated
              things.
              <br />
              <strong
                >Third, web development business requires development knowledge. </strong
              ><br />
              Anyone can be ripped off in areas they don't know.
              <br />
            </div>
            <div>
              Then how do we avoid these pitfalls? Weâ€™ll cover that in the next
              column.
