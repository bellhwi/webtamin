              Small businesses can get crushed by large companies and "wiped
              off" within months after launching. But yours doesn't have to. It
              all comes down to how you promote your small business online in
              this competitive market.
            </div>

            <div>
              So, I have prepared a guide for small business owners who aren't
              much familiar with technical terms but want to grow online. Let's
              get started.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                1. Identify Your Business Niche
              </h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              The first step, which is a crucial one, is to find your business
              niche. Here's how you can do that:
            </div>

            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Understand Your Business</span
              ><br />Find out what your ideal customers are looking for. This
              will help customize your offerings to meet their demands and
              promote your small business online.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Identify Your Ideal Customers </span
              ><br />Think about what products/services you offer and the
              problems you solve for your customers.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Study Your Competition</span
              ><br />Analyze other small businesses in your industry to identify
              their strengths and weaknesses. This will help you come up with
              your unique selling point (USP). If you want to survive and grow
              in a competitive market, you should be different from your
              competitors. Choose something that the customers find valuable.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Get Feedback </span><br />Identifying
              your niche alone isn't enough. You must also get feedback from
              potential customers to ensure that you are meeting their needs.
            </div>
            <div>
              A business, whether small or large, has to evolve and continuously
              meet the changing market landscape. So, make sure your business
              stays relevant by regularly revisiting your niche.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                2. Write Engaging Copy For Your Products/Services
              </h2>
            </div>
            <div>
              Suppose Business A says, "Our coffee maker brews quickly," and
              Business B says, "Get fresh within minutes after waking up with
              our coffee maker's quick brewing." Who do you think will attract
              more customers with their copy? Obviously, Business B, as they
              focused on benefits over features and had more engaging copy.
            </div>
            <div>
              Similarly, you must write captivating copy to promote your small
              business online, attract customers, and generate more leads. But
              first, you have to understand your audience by finding out their
              needs and the language they use. Only then can you craft copy that
              resonates with them.
            </div>
            <div>
              Another thing to keep in mind is using clear and concise language.
              Avoid jargon and complex sentences at all costs. Your copy should
              be straight to the point and easy to understand. The headline of
              your copy should be catchy so that potential customers want to
              read more. With a dull heading, the users will skip your content
              no matter how good it is.
            </div>
            <div>
              And don't forget to include a Call to Action (CTA). Guide your
              customers to the next step, whether it's contacting your business
              or buying something. Some examples of CTAs are:
            </div>
            <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
              <li>Contact Us</li>
              <li>Give Us a Call</li>
              <li>Subscribe to Our Newsletter</li>
              <li>Read More</li>
              <li>Learn More</li>
              <li>Buy Now</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Build a Website
              </h2>
            </div>
            <div>
              A website can make or break your small business, so it's crucial
              to focus on this aspect. Without a website, you don't have an
              "established online face", and you will lose potential customers.
              But building it from scratch can be a daunting task for business
              owners.
            </div>
            <div>
              Luckily, you don't have to worry about anything as I offer a
              comprehensive
              <a
                href="https://webtamin.co/#services"
                target="_blank"
                class="text-blue-500"
                >web design service</a
              >. I won't go into the technical details, but rest assured, I will
              create a brand-new website from scratch to promote your small
              business online.
            </div>
            <div>
              But you may ask why I need a website. Here are some solid reasons:
            </div>
            <div>Increase your online visibility to reach a wider audience</div>
            <ul class="ml-4 list-disc">
              <li>Gain more credibility</li>
              <li>Develop your brand identity</li>
              <li>Get more leads</li>
              <li>
                Provide better customer service by answering FAQs on your
                website
              </li>
              <li>Share blogs and other content to build authority</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              Overall, getting your website is a cost-effective marketing
              strategy because you pay once and enjoy the benefits for a
              lifetime.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                4. Content Marketing & Blogging to Promote Your Small Business
                Online
              </h2>
            </div>
            <div>
              Think of content marketing as giving potential customers free
              samples of your knowledge so that they will buy your offerings. It
              builds trust, which means your potential customers are more likely
              to purchase from you than your competitors.
            </div>
            <div>
              Another benefit is that your content is readily available on the
              internet, meaning anyone can access it even years after it has
              been published. This is the opposite of what happens when you run
              ads, which disappear when the campaign ends.
            </div>
            <div>
              Blogging is an effective way to do content marketing. You share
              articles and blog posts on the topics your customers are searching
              for to show your expertise and sell your products/services.
            </div>
            <div>
              So, if you want to start blogging, find topics that can solve your
              customers' problems. Then, research and write helpful,
              SEO-optimized content, sharing tips and answering questions.
            </div>
            <div class="md:text-center font-semibold">
              Bonus Tip: Share your blogs on social media to get more reach.
            </div>

              SEO (Search Engine Optimization) effectively increases organic
              traffic to promote your small business online. You can drive
              traffic to your website, app, social media pages, or other
              mediums.
            </div>
            <div>
              Now, SEO is not easy as it takes time and a lot of expertise to
              show your face in the search results. However, one easy way is to
              get help from experts. I will do on-page SEO to rank you higher on
              Google search results. As a result, more potential customers can
              find you online and contact you for your products/services.
            </div>
            <div>
              But you must be thinking about the benefits. Well, let's take a
              look at the importance of SEO for small businesses:
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">More Customers</span>: Effective SEO
              techniques bring you more customers through organic search who are
              more likely to convert.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Brand Awareness</span>: If more
              potential customers keep seeing your business repeatedly, this
              will increase brand awareness.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Outperform Competitors</span>: Your
              small business can rank higher in search results than your
              competitors. In fact, you can actually "ethically steal their
              customers".
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="font-semibold">Cost-Effective</span>: SEO targets
              people who are actively looking for your products/services. This
              makes it more cost-effective than paid advertising.

                How Can I Help Promote Your Small Business Online?

            <div>
              I'm Johnny Kim, founder of Webtamin, a web design and development
              agency in Sacramento, CA, United States. My comprehensive services
              also include SEO and content marketing. I offer unlimited
              revisions, 24/7 customer support, and lifetime maintenance.
            </div>
            <div>
              My aim is not just to develop a simple website but an
              SEO-optimized one that drives traffic and generates leads. And I
              don't charge huge lump sums but monthly subscription fees to avoid
              burdening small business owners.
