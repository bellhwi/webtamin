              The duration of the website development may vary depending on the
              design, number of pages, functionality, and capabilities of the
              agency. In the case of a customized design homepage, it takes
              approximately 4 to 12 weeks. What is the agency doing during this
              time?

              To avoid making the content difficult, we made it easy and
              concise, focusing on the core as much as possible. If you read
              this column, the wait time during website development will be a
              reasonable wait. You will also be able to see the flow of the
              website development process.

            <div>
              Let's take an example of the actual Webtamin homepage development
              process.

                1. Analyze business needs
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/5-reasons-why-website-development-takes-long/planning.webp"
              alt="website planning"
            />
            <div>
              Why do you create a website? The agency must first understand
              exactly

              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >what the customer wants to achieve.</span
              >
              After that, we need time to figure out how to reflect this on the
              website.
            </div>
            <div>
              The agency communicates with the customer to provide a website
              that meets their goals. In the early stages of development, they
              usually ask the customer for additional information, ask for
              clarification, and answer questions. This work is needed to ensure
              that the information needed is determined once the development
              process begins.
            </div>
            <div>
              For example, Webtamin aims to create and service a website to
              customers. Therefore,
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >gaining customer trust is the top priority.</span
              >
              To do this, present potential customers with previous work,
              customer testimonials, unique selling points, and columns.
            </div>

            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                2. Aim target customers
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/5-reasons-why-website-development-takes-long/target.webp"
              alt="dart target"
            />
            <div>
              Several visual elements make up a website. The agency needs to
              decide the layout, color, font, and phrase of the website. What's
              important here is that they need a design that
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-bold">
                takes into account the target customers.</span
              >
              They need to focus on the age group, preferences, and
              characteristics of the target customers.
            </div>
            <div>
              For example, the target customers of Webtamin are business owners.
              Business owners are often middle-aged individuals. Therefore, the
              wording on the website chose a relatively formal expression. The
              style is also aimed at explaining enough information. Young
              customers, on the other hand, tend to prefer relatively informal
              expressions. Concise phrases may be more appropriate than long and
              detailed explanations.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-bold">
                Designing a website that suits your target customers is
                time-consuming.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Apply responsive design
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/5-reasons-why-website-development-takes-long/responsive-design.webp"
              alt="various electronic devices"
            />
            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Responsive design is a design practice that makes it visible on
                all mobile device screens, including smartphones, tablets, and
                laptops.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              In recent years, responsive design has become essential as the use
              of mobile devices has increased. However, there are still many
              websites on the Internet that do not apply to it. Have you ever
              had an experience where you visited the website from your phone
              and found it hard to see because of the small font size? Have you
              ever seen an unusual enlargement of only a part of the website?
              These are common things in websites without responsive design.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, what does a website that reflects responsive
              design look like? For example, the website you are looking at now
              has a responsive design. If you're reading this now on your laptop
              or desktop, try accessing it on your smartphone. You'll be able to
              see the
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >design changes tailored to the size of the small screen.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              Applying the responsive design requires additional work during the
              development phase.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                4. Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/5-reasons-why-website-development-takes-long/seo.webp"

            />
            <div>
              Search engine optimization is the task of making websites appear
              high on search engines.
            </div>
            <div>
              If you search for something on Google or Naver, the results appear
              in order. The higher the search engine optimization score, the
              more it will be shown on the front page and the top. Conversely,
              the lower the score, the more difficult it is to access because it
              is behind the search ranking.
            </div>
            <div>
              Search engine optimization is essential for effective marketing.
              Even if it's a very nice website,

              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >it's useless if the customer can't find it.</span
              >
              Webtamin, for example, has applied Search Engine Optimization.
              Therefore, searching for a business name exposes the result to the
              top.
            </div>
            <div>
              Making websites stand out to potential customers is one of the
              reasons for longer development.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">5. Testing</h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/5-reasons-why-website-development-takes-long/quality-assurance.webp"
              alt="people pointing fingers at laptop screen"
            />
            <div class="mt-4 mb-8">
              Once the agency has completed the development of the website, it
              must ensure that

              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >there are no issues in many aspects.</span
              >
              They will verify the following items.
            </div>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
              <li>Are all the components of the website visible?</li>
              <li>Has the responsive design been applied properly?</li>
              <li>Does the function work without problems?</li>
              <li>
                Is there any problem with performance such as loading delay?
              </li>
              <li>Is there any inconvenience from the user's point of view?</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              If any of these issues are present, users will have doubts about
              their expertise. It makes the website look very less professional
              in their business. This makes it easier for potential customers to

              <span class="text-red-500 font-bold">leave the website.</span>
            </div>
            <div>
              For example, the Webtamin website was also verified according to
