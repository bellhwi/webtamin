              There are two ways to create a website. The first method is to
              build a website with a web builder and a pre-made template. The
              other method is to develop a custom website by coding. This
              article will cover

              >
              You can see how custom websites can go beyond these limits. Let's
              dive in.

                1. Unique Branding
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/branding.webp"
              alt="guy is doing web design"
            />
            <div>
              Brand means an impression of a company's products and services.
              Branding refers to the overall process of creating a brand.
              Branding aims to give consumers a distinctive recognition of the
              company.
            </div>
            <div>
              The primary purpose of the website is to maximize branding. All
              website elements, including layout, logo, color, typography, and
              images, should represent the company's unique brand. The website
              made with a web builder is limited in design.
            </div>
            <div>
              The template comes in a pre-made form of design parts. The range
              of adjustable elements may vary depending on the template, but
              most are constrained. Therefore,
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >implementing a design that fits your company's brand is
                challenging.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites have 100% control over their
              design. All visual elements of the website can be applied as
              desired. You can design the website to represent your brand
              without any limitations.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/mockup.webp"
              alt="mock-up of webtamin's client homepage"
              class="lg:max-w-screen-sm"
            />
            <div>
              The image above is a draft of our customer's website. We design
              websites without online templates for unique branding. From the
              hands of experienced designers, the optimal design for your brand
              that considers aesthetics, usability, and brand image is born.
              Therefore,
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >imprinting the brand on visitors is much more
                advantageous</span
              >
              than doing so on a uniform template website.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                2. No Restrictions
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/coding.webp"
              alt="lady is coding"
            />
            <div>
              The template website is subject to functional restrictions.
              Websites can only be
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >built within the scope of pre-made features.</span
              >
              There are often restrictions on integrating payment systems,
              linking external business tools, search and filter functions, and
              the ability to provide customized content to users. It may sound
              vague, so I got the story below for you.
            </div>
            <div class="italic">
              Here's a law firm website made by the web builder. It has a blog
              section that has 100 articles in various categories, such as
              inheritance law, immigration law, and divorce law. Visitor Paul is
              curious about the U.S. immigration law. He'd like to read only
              posts related to immigration laws out of 100 articles. However,
              the blog page does not show anything to filter those. The only way
              to navigate the page is to scroll it manually. He feels
              uncomfortable and wants to look around other law firms' websites.
            </div>
            <div class="italic">
              Later, he found a custom-made law firm website. This website also
              has a blog inside. On the page, the inheritance law, immigration
              law, and divorce law are separated by tabs. The sorting function
              exists, allowing you to view posts in order of latest and
              popularity. It has a function where you can search posts around
              specific keywords. He is satisfied with the more convenient user
              experience compared to the previous website.
            </div>

            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/filter.webp"
              alt="filter function in webtamin's sample project"
              class="lg:max-w-screen-sm"
            />
            <div>
              Here's another example. The image above is a blog website, one of
              Webtamin's projects. It shows a real-time filtering of blog posts
              when typing search titles.
            </div>
            <div>
              You can see how custom websites can
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >implement features aimed at visitors' needs</span
              >
              because there are no technical limitations to developing the
              function.
            </div>
            <div>
              Websites that meet the needs of visitors will have a positive
              impact on the brand's impression. Brand recognition is the
              starting point for creating product and service demand.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Faster Loading
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-you-need-to-create-a-custom-website/loading.webp"
              alt="loading bar"
            />
            <div>
              When you visit the website, you may have clicked go back or closed
              the window because of the long loading time. After three seconds
              of loading, most visitors leave the site. A slow loading impacts
              the user's experience significantly. Therefore, the difference
              between 1 and 2 seconds of loading time is critical when creating
              a website.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >Template websites typically have slower loading times.</span
              >
              Some factors can slow down a website's loading, and the
              template-based website is almost impossible to fix the problems.
              These include;
            </div>
            <div>
              First, an oversized image file. You need a blog thumbnail image of
              400 x 300 pixels here. However, the original image you want to use
              is 4000 x 3000 pixels in size. In this case, you should reduce the
              loading speed by downsizing the image to match the thumbnail. This
              is called image optimization; sometimes, the template website does
              not support it. This causes the loading of unnecessarily large
              size image files, which takes more time.
            </div>
            <div>
              Next are JavaScript and CSS files. Don't be flustered by
              unfamiliar terms. Think of it simply as a file related to the
              appearance and behavior of the website. Templates often load these
              files, even from unnecessary pages.
            </div>
            <div>
              In addition, template websites are relatively slow to load due to
              messy code, bloated third-party plug-ins, and excessive external
              script file calls.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites can optimize image files to the
              correct size. You can develop related files to load only where
              they are needed. You can reduce loading time by optimizing code.
              You can have
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >the most control over all the technical aspects of loading
                speed.</span
              >

              The image above results from the speed test on Webtamin's official
              website. As a result of speed optimization, it shows a high score
              in performance. A website that loads fast will increase visitors'
              satisfaction. Visitors who are satisfied with the website have no
              choice but to have a good impression of the brand.

              So far, we've covered three reasons why you want to have custom
              websites. The reasons are as follows.
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Unique Branding</li>
              <li>No Restrictions</li>
              <li>Faster Loading</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              Creating websites that
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >satisfy users is the starting point</span
              >
              for making a profit online. The template website has the advantage
              of being relatively easy to make, having a low price, and having a
              short development time. However, there are restrictions on
              creating websites that fit the brand perfectly.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, custom websites are customized for everything
              in design, function, and performance. It's relatively expensive
              and takes a long time to build, but it's optimized for
              representing the brand's unique identity.
            </div>
            <div>
              You can make a wise decision by knowing the difference between
              template-based websites and custom websites.
