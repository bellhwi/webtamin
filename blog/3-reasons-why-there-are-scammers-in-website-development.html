              Are you confident you won't be scammed by requesting the website
              development? Then, you may exit this page. However, If not, please
              take your time and read this article.
            </div>
            <div>
              There are several types of fraud in the website development
              industry. We will look at the

                >prevailing customer deception behavior in web business.</span
              >
              There are inherent reasons why website development is vulnerable
              to these scams. Let's break it into three reasons.

                1. Low Financial Barrier
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/low-financial-barrier.webp"
              alt="low financial barrier"
            />
            <div>
              Starting a website development business costs relatively little.
              Let me give you an example.
            </div>
            <div>
              How much would it cost to open a cafe? First, you have to pay a
              premium and rent for the actual use of the building. Wallpaper,
              paint, counters, tables, chairs, props, coffee machines, etc.,
              must be purchased for the interior and equipment. You must also
              pay for coffee ingredients, drinks, and dessert food. There are
              labor costs for hiring employees as well. You also have to pay
              utility bills such as electricity and water bills. A large amount
              of money is spent to start the business.
            </div>
            <div>
              What about the website development business? Let's look at the
              most accessible business form an individual runs. You don't need a
              building. You can make and operate a website at home. You don't
              need interior design. The design of the website is interior
              design. One laptop with an Internet connection is sufficient for
              equipment. No labor costs are required. You can start a business
              with
              <strong class="bg-yellow-200">barely any expense.</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
              This is where the so-called 'Eat-and-run' problem occurs. They can
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >close the business after the customer's down payment.</span
              >
              This amount is more than their initial expense for the business.
              This is why many ghost companies disappear only for advance
              payments. It is a problem caused by the low financial barriers to
              entering the industry.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                2. Fake Information
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/anonymous.webp"
              alt="anonymous image"
            />
            <div>
              How do previous ghost companies open consumers' wallets? The
              Internet is where anonymity is guaranteed. It's hard for someone
              to identify you unless you disclose it.
            </div>
            <div>
              Bad website development businesses take advantage of this. They
              fabricate websites with
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >fake portfolios, careers, and reviews.</span
              >
              They pretend to be professionals. It is not easy for customers to
              determine the authenticity of this information. Eventually, they
              are deceived by manipulated information and pay for the service
              fee.
            </div>
            <div>
              The customer will then receive poor deliverables. It is an unknown
              company not registered as a business, even if you try to take
              legal action afterward. The country or region to which the company
              belongs is also unknown and cannot even be identified. The email
              and phone number of the company you received are also unavailable
              for one-time contact.
            </div>
            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Fraud companies deceive customers with their fake
                appearance.</span

              He cries wine and sells vinegar.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Technical Knowledge
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/3-reasons-for-the-high-number-of-scammers-in-website-development/coding.webp"
              alt="coding image"
            />
            <div>
              Web development requires technical knowledge. Customers in other
              industries rarely have it. Therefore, Knowing the technical
              aspects of how websites are created is hard. How do scammers
              deceive customers with this?
            </div>
            <div>
              Let's take another example of a previous cafe. Customers order
              coffee made from high-quality beans. However, the bad cafe owner
              takes advantage of the fact that customers don't know coffee well.
              And they serve coffee with low-cost beans sold at regular marts.
              The customer doesn't know yet, is reluctant, and asks to check.
              The vice owner will then mix unknown jargon and say that's how it
              is. The customer agrees as if there is no choice.
            </div>
            <div>
              The above story can be applied directly to the web development
              business. Replace web development for the cafe—a website for
              coffee. Read the basic/premium websites by substituting them for
              low-cost/high-end.
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >Such substandard deliverables are deceiving customers</span
              >
              as if they were industry standards.
            </div>
            <div>
              On the other hand, they charge excessive development costs for
              essential services. A simple code correction can cost you 30% of
              the development cost.
            </div>
            <div>
              Some businesses steal copyrighted online materials without
              permission. Customers may be caught in legal action later on for
              copyright infringement without knowing this.
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Without basic knowledge of web development, you may be
                vulnerable to fraud.</span
              >
            </div>
            <div class="py-8"><hr class="w-1/2" /></div>
            <div>
              So far, we've looked at three reasons why there are so many
              scammers in the web development industry. Let's sum up.
            </div>
            <div class="space-y-4">
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold">1. Low Financial Barrier </span><br />
                Some people think they have nothing to lose and turn their backs
                on customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold">2. Fake Information </span><br />
                It's not hard at all to open an online store with fabricated
                things.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="font-bold">3. Technical Knowledge </span><br />
                Anyone can be ripped off in areas they don't know.
              </p>

            <div>
              Then how do we avoid these pitfalls? We’ll cover that in the next
