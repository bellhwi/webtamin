            <div>
              Do you know how websites are created? You might think, ‚ÄúDo I need
              to know?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know and that is why I leave it to the agency,
              man.‚Äù üòÇ‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              You‚Äôre right. You don‚Äôt have to know any technical knowledge such
              as design and development required to create a website. However,
              we recommend that you know roughly about the website design
              process as a client.‚Äã
            </div>
            <div>
              The reason is that you need to know this to
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >communicate closely with the agency.</span
              >
              If you don‚Äôt know this, you can‚Äôt understand the language of the
              agency. You may wonder what this means when the agency doesn‚Äôt use
              another language or something. For example, it‚Äôs like this.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div class="italic">
              Hello World Agency: Hello, sir. The current website design draft
              has been completed and I‚Äôm delivering the mock-up. After that, it
              will be developed by coding and tested using automation tools.
              Please note that we will help you register the domain at the end
              of the project and use the hosting of the xyz platform for
              distribution ^^‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              If you understand what this all means, you can go back. If not,
              make sure to read this article. And when the scroll hits the floor
              in 5 minutes, come back here. You will experience the magic of
              understanding 100% of what the Hello World agency says.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              Once again, don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not rocket science. It‚Äôs enough to
              know only
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-bold">the basic knowledge</span>
              covered in this article. Then, let‚Äôs take a look at the forest
              called website design. The development of a website will mainly go
              through the following five stages.
            </div>
            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>

                1. Planning
              </h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Planning is the stage of coming up with the purpose and content
                of the website.</span
              >The general purpose of website development is as follows.‚Äã
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>
                Business: Increase sales through product and service
                introduction
              </li>
              <li>Individual: Getting a job by proving one‚Äôs skills‚Äã</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
              After you decide on your purpose, you‚Äôll be thinking about what
              content you‚Äôll include on your website. It mainly consists of
              product and service descriptions, company introductions, portfolio
              introductions, and inquiries. After that, we collect the necessary
              information on the website. The information you need includes
              images, videos, and writing on each page.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              The reason we have to come up with the idea is that the agency and
              the client have to be on the same page. What‚Äôs in the client‚Äôs
              head should be shared with the agency as it is. I know it sounds
              so vague. Let me give you an example.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-process-explained-in-5-steps/website-application-en.gif"

              height="375"
              alt="website application"
            />
            <div>
              Webtamin has two questionnaires for the client. The first
              questionnaire consists of basic questions. The client will answer
              basic information such as the main purpose of the website, the
              available images and videos, and the information required.
            </div>

            <div>
              ‚ÄãThe second one is an in-depth questionnaire. The content consists
              of more in-depth questions compared to basic questions. The client
              writes in-depth information related to the business, including
              target customers, new customer inflow channels, and
              differentiation from other companies.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              Based on this, Webtamin analyzes businesses and visitors in depth.
              The result is content that captivates the visitor and achieves the
              client‚Äôs purpose.
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >The simple informational writing is nothing but only passes
                through the visitor‚Äôs eyes.</span
              >

            <div class="flex pt-8">

                2. Designing
              </h2>
            </div>

            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Designing is a step in planning the appearance of a
                website.</span
              >In the beginning, you will produce a rough blueprint of the
              website‚Äôs layout. This blueprint is called a wireframe.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              After that, based on the wireframe, the agency will consider the
              following visual factors.‚Äã
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Color</li>
              <li>Font</li>
              <li>Blank space</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
              It will then determine these factors and apply them to the
              wireframe to create a design. This design is called a mock-up. The
              reason why we need a mock-up is to discuss the design with our
              customers. The advantage of the mock-up is that you can create
              design results much faster than the actual website design.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-process-explained-in-5-steps/website-design-mockup.webp"

            />
            <div>
              Webtamin uses design tools to produce and utilize a mock-up. It
              reflects the reference website provided by a customer and design
              trends. After that, the completed mock-up will lead to a design
              discussion with a customer.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              A typical website agency usually places a limit on the number of
              design changes at this stage. In other words, only a few design
              revisions can be made.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              Webtamin provides unlimited design revisions until customers are
              satisfied.

            <div>
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-bold">
                Developing is the work of implementing designs and functions on
                a website. </span
              >There are two main ways to develop a website.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              The first method is to use a web builder. A web builder is a tool
              that helps you create a website without programming knowledge. The
              web builder is a platform like WordPress or Wix that you‚Äôve heard
              of at least once.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              Web builders are easy to use, so most companies use them. However,
              there is a limit to customize the design.
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >This makes it hard to express the unique identity of the
                brand.</span
              >
              There is a problem that functions can only be developed within the
              scope allowed by the web builder, as well.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              The second is the method of coding. Coding is, in short, giving
              commands to a computer. When creating a website, is developed by
              opening a program such as a notepad to write commands.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              This method is less accessible because it requires specialized
              technical knowledge. Website costs are also relatively high
              because they require expertise and time compared to web builders.
              However, if you choose this method, you can create a completely
              customized website. This is because there are no restrictions on
              the designs and functions that can be developed.
            </div>

                >there are no restrictions on the development of design and

              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Testing is a step to ensure that all the features on the
                website work well.</span
              >Test the following;‚Äã
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>if all the pages are shown well</li>
              <li>if buttons or links work well</li>
              <li>
                if you can see it well on mobile devices such as tablets and
                smartphones
              </li>
              <li>if the loading speed is too slow‚Äã</li>
            </ol>

            <div>
              The reason for testing is to satisfy the user. If it takes more
              than 3 seconds to load the page, users want to go back. Users want
              to close the window if the content is too small to read on their
              smartphone.‚Äã
            </div>

            <div>
              There are often agencies that skip this testing phase. If it‚Äôs a
              minor problem such as typos and design mistakes, it‚Äôs okay.
              However, serious problems can also occur, such as missing
              important links or malfunctioning buttons. If you don‚Äôt recognize
              this and discover it after a long time, the loss becomes
              indescribable.‚Äã

              Webtamin doesn‚Äôt trust humans when it comes to errors. The reason
              is that humans are bound to make mistakes. Even experienced
              developers can create errors with one typo among many codes.
            </div>

            <div>
              Webtamin utilizes an automated testing program to address this
              issue. We use a tool called Cypress to
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >create and conduct tests on things that people may miss.</span
              >
              Since the website is created by coding, the test code can also be
              written in detail without limitation. That‚Äôs why Webtamin‚Äôs
              homepage is bug-free and sturdy üòÅ

              If you‚Äôre still reading this, you‚Äôre a wise person üëç Finally,
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >the deployment is the step of registering the website on the
                Internet for all to see.</span

            </div>

            <div>
              A domain is the address of a website. For example,
              <u>https://webtamin.co/en</u> is a domain for a Webtamin website.
              To register the website address you want, you will pay
              accordingly.
            </div>

            <div>
              Hosting is a website space rental service. The website consists of
              files such as texts, images, and videos. For others to view the
              website, these files must exist on the Internet. To do that, we
              need space on the Internet to hold these files. This space is
              called a server. Hosting refers to a service that lends this
              server.
            </div>

            <div>
              Some bad agencies may overcharge their hosting servers. They also
              ask for a larger amount than the actual hosting fee. The customer
              may not know this technical part and may not know and be subjected
              to it.
            </div>

            <div>
              Webtamin uses a free hosting platform called Netlify. The
              corresponding amount will only be charged if the free available
              traffic(=number of website visitors) is exceeded. Domain costs
              also charged only the actual amount.
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Webtamin is based on transparency in principle for all service
                costs.</span

              So far, we‚Äôve looked at the five stages of the website‚Äôs
              development process. It‚Äôs obvious, but the order or details of
              each agency may vary. If you request website development in the
