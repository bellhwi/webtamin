              satisfied while browsing the website. I'm sure you've done so once
              by frowning and hitting the go-back arrow or closing the window.

              What would you do if stuck to this screen for 3 seconds? Open a
              new tab on your browser now. Then, visit three random websites and
              come back. I'll give you 15 seconds.
            </div>
            <div>15, 14, 13, ... (Why are you still there!?)</div>
            <div>
              I'm sure you returned to this article in just 15 seconds. On
              average, you've noticed that accessing the website takes
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >less than a second or two</span
              >. What about your website? Visitors don't wait more than three
              seconds to get to the first page. This very short second, a second
              or two, is critical on a website. You probably know this from your
              experience.
            </div>
            <div>
              No matter how good the content is, slow-loading websites
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >don't even get the opportunity</span
              >
              to show visitors. As a result, the slow speed is one of the
              deadliest issues that cause visitors to leave.
            </div>
            <p class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl">Cause</p>
            <div>
              The main reasons for the slow loading speed are the following;
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Large unoptimized image files</li>
              <li>Inefficient code</li>
              <li>Excessive traffic from hosting server</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl">Solution</p>
            <div>
              The simplest solution to improve the loading speed is to optimize
              the images. Don't panic. It is technical knowledge, so you don't
              have to understand it. Just notice there are things like this, and
              that's enough.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-never-fall-to-these-3-pitfalls/code.webp"
              width="1172"
              height="225"
              alt="a HTML image tag"
            />
            <div>
              The image above is the code responsible for the logo on the
              Webtamin homepage. One of the easiest ways to optimize your image
              file is by changing the extension. An extension is a character
              that comes at the end of the filename to distinguish between file
              types (the red underlined part of the image).
            </div>
            <div>
              Mainly, image files use a lot of .jpg or .png format. Changing
              this extension to .webp increases the compression efficiency of
              the file. High compression efficiency cuts down the size of image
              files, reducing websites' loading time. To reduce loading time, we
              changed the original extension of the logo image, .png, to .webp.
              Again, you don't have to understand it.
            </div>

              Google provides a website speed measurement tool called PageSpeed

            <div>
              You might have experience where you accessed a website with your
              phone, and it took a lot of work to read the content in small
              letters. Sometimes, only a part of the website appears on the
              screen, and you must scroll with your finger. It is because the
              website does not have a <i>responsive design*</i>.
            </div>
            <div class="italic">
              *Responsive design: A design method that makes it more visible on
              all electronic devices' screens, including cell phones, tablets,
              and laptops.
            </div>
            <div>
              According to the statistics, smartphone usage by the global
              population is approximately 87%. The system that sorts the results
              when searching Google determines whether a website is visible on a
              mobile device, which is a significant measure.
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Websites that don't have a responsive design will inevitably
                fall behind</span
              >.
            </div>
            <div>
              On websites, content is a product, and design is an appearance.
              People have doubts about poor appearance products. When people
              look at websites with crude design, they intuitively feel that
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >content will also be useless</span

            <div>
              Some websites have elements that are aesthetically inconvenient to
              look at in addition to responsive designs. Below are the usual
              cases;
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>Hard-to-read font</li>
              <li>Inharmonious colors</li>
              <li>Unorganized <i>layout*</i></li>
            </ol>
            <div class="italic">
              *Layout: Display placement of menus, articles, pictures, etc.,
              that make up the website page.
            </div>
            <p class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl">Solution</p>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-never-fall-to-these-3-pitfalls/responsive-design.webp"
              alt="a responsive design"
              width="687"
              height="334"
            />
            <div>
              The solution is to
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >apply the responsive design while maintaining visual
                consistency</span
              >. The image above is one of Webtamin customers' websites. The
              left is a laptop, and the right is a smartphone. You can see that
              the layout is applied to match the size of each screen.
            </div>

            <div class="flex pt-8">
              <div class="vl"></div>
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold p-2 ml-2 lg:text-2xl">
                3. Weak content
              </h2>
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-never-fall-to-these-3-pitfalls/languages.webp"
              width="799"
              height="500"
              alt="different languages over the world"
            />
            <div>
              You've seen so-called translated websites where the content could
              be easier to read. But most websites have no problem with it.
              Here's the thing.
            </div>
            <div>
              The most problematic part of the website is the superficial
              content. Many websites have a high loading speed with a responsive
              design. However, if you look inside, the content is often poor.
            </div>
            <div>
              This type of content degrades the website's expertise and
              credibility. Visitors may be briefly interested in colorful
              designs but
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold"
                >quickly become disappointed and disengaged</span
              >
              from meaningless content. What kind of content will make visitors
              grow bored?
            </div>
            <p class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl">Cause</p>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-never-fall-to-these-3-pitfalls/articles.webp"
              width="640"
              height="427"
              alt="bunch of books"
            />
            <div>
              The most common example is rambling content full of text. These
              texts are usually not interested in what the reader wants. It
              often contains too much information or lists the content without
              depth. This superficial content cannot move the visitors' hearts.
              Business websites that don't touch the hearts of visitors
              <span class="text-red-500 font-semibold">can't create demand</span
              >.
            </div>
            <p class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl">Solution</p>
            <div>
              The solution is to create the content that visitors want.
              Accomplishing it is not as easy as you might think. Creating such
              content requires in-depth consideration of the purpose of people
              visiting the website.
            </div>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 font-bold">
              <li>
                What was the purpose of the visitor's access to the website?
              </li>
              <li>What is the problem that the visitor has?</li>
              <li>What kind of answer can you give to the question?</li>
            </ol>
            <div>
              The content created after such consideration has an attractive
              power. Visitors who find answers to their problems cannot quickly
              leave the website.
            </div>
            <img
              src="../images/blog/website-design-never-fall-to-these-3-pitfalls/service-en.webp"
              width="2840"
              height="922"
              alt="Webtamin's services"
            />
            <div>
              For example, some Webtamin homepage content has a service
              introduction section. People considering a website design request
              are always asked, 'What is the difference between these agencies?'
              The content of Webtamin's differentiation suggests a solution to
              this.
              <span class="bg-yellow-200 font-semibold"
                >Content that reads the visitor's mind proactively and provides
                an answer to it will never fail</span
              >.
            </div>

            <div class="py-8"><hr class="w-1/2" /></div>
            <div>
              When you request the website design, check the company's
              portfolio. If you find any of these three elements on the website,
              we recommend you go back or close the window without hesitation,
              as in the example earlier.
